# SQL Portfolio Projects

This repository contains multiple SQL projects that I’ve created to practice and showcase my data analysis skills. Each project is based on a real-world business scenario and focuses on writing clean, efficient SQL to answer practical questions.

## What’s inside

Each project folder typically includes:
- `schema/` – SQL scripts to create tables (database schema)
- `data/` – Sample or reference datasets (or link to source)
- `queries/` – Analysis queries to answer business questions
- `README.md` (per project) – Short explanation of the problem, dataset, and insights

## Skills demonstrated

- Writing joins, aggregations, and subqueries
- Using window functions and CTEs for advanced analysis
- Cleaning and transforming data in SQL
- Answering business questions with clear, well-structured queries

I will keep adding new SQL projects as I learn and explore more scenarios.
